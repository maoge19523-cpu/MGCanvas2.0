MGStudio is an all-in-one AI workbench for creators. On an **infinite canvas** you can drag, connect, and combine various AI capabilities — text-to-image, image-to-image, AI video generation, GPT multimodal chat — all seamlessly in one interface. The canvas **AI assistant is a real Agent**: state a goal in one sentence and it plans and acts on its own — creating nodes, wiring them up, running generations, checking tasks — with every step visible and the whole run rollbackable. Paired with **Photoshop panels** and **Chrome extensions**, asset collection and creative workflows flow together.

## AI Models

Built-in **ModelScope** free API, ready out of the box:

| Type | Model | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Chat | Qwen3-235B | Tongyi Qianwen flagship, reasoning/writing |
| Chat | Qwen3-VL-235B | Multimodal, image analysis |
| Image | Qwen-Image-2512 | Best Chinese text rendering, posters/banners |
| Image | FLUX.2-klein-9B | Best visual quality |
| Image | Z-Image-Turbo | 1-2s fast generation |
| Image | Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 | Edit images by talking |
| Video | agnes-video-v2.0 | Free video generation |

Beyond the built-in free quota, "API Settings → Add platform" connects platforms from your own accounts. Model names are kept per platform and never swapped between them:

| Protocol | Platforms |
|----------|-----------|
| OpenAI-compatible | Relays / official-compatible endpoints (gpt-image, Nano Banana, …); presets: Lingjing API, Agnes AI, EXELLOME, FHL, VIP-GPT |
| Async protocol | APIMart |
| Native Gemini | Google Gemini (images via `/v1beta`) |
| Ark | Volcengine (Doubao Seedream images, Seedance video) |
| RunningHub | OpenAPI workflows |
| CLI | Jimeng CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI, Antigravity CLI |
| Design agent | Lovart (Access Key / Secret Key signing) |

Provider dropdowns only list platforms **with a configured key**; platforms without one never appear in generation nodes and are never chosen as the default.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Smart Canvas AI assistant (real Agent)** — state a goal in one sentence and the model plans and acts over multiple rounds (create nodes, wire them up, run generations, check tasks); every step streams live and the whole run can be rolled back
- 📊 **Table-driven batch production** — one table drives batch image/video generation: per-row assets and prompts, real per-row progress, stop anytime, and a single result node per batch
- 🎭 **Lovart design agent** — connect with an Access Key / Secret Key for image and video generation, asset upload and result download
- 💬 **Chat-style creation** — LLM nodes and GPT chat support multi-turn context, selectable personas (default "Prompt Optimizer") and a live thinking process
- 🎨 **Infinite Canvas** — free zoom, drag, and connect for creation
- ⚡ **Node Workflows** — image/video/LLM nodes connected in chains
- 🤖 **Auto-Place on Canvas** — AI results auto-create nodes, no manual import
- 💡 **Smart Suggestion Bar** — auto-popup "change outfit / change scene / add camera move" one-click continuation
- 🔍 **@ Reference** — type @ in the input box to reference canvas nodes as source material
- 👤 **Face Blur** — one-click blur all faces in a video to protect the privacy of people in the frame (YuNet detection)
- 🔌 **Plugin System** — Photoshop panels, Chrome extensions
- 🌐 **Multi-Repo Updates** — GitHub / Gitee / ModelScope three sources
- 🇨🇳 **Chinese Optimized** — deep Qwen ecosystem integration

## Download & Updates

Installers and update sources:

| Platform | URL |
|----------|-----|
| GitHub | https://github.com/maoge19523-cpu/MGCanvas2.0 |
| Gitee | https://github.com/maoge19523-cpu/MGCanvas2.0 |
| ModelScope | https://github.com/maoge19523-cpu/MGCanvas2.0 |

The app checks all three sources for the latest version on startup, pushes update notifications, and upgrades with one click (ModelScope installers live under `electron-release/` in that repo — the same source the app uses for mirror updates).

---

## Desktop Client (Electron · Beta)

> New packaging route: **Electron** with its own Chromium engine (consistent behavior across platforms, no more system WebView differences), with electron-updater auto-update.

- Source & build docs: **desktop/README.md**
- Reuses the existing frontend through a pywebview compatibility bridge (window.pywebview.api) — native dialogs / window controls / system tray with zero frontend changes
- **Fully shares data with the official build**: same port 3000 and same data directory (Windows `%APPDATA%/MGStudio`, macOS `~/MGStudio`) — canvases, settings and chat history are shared, **no data re-download or migration needed, just install and run**; if the official build is already running, the Electron app reuses its backend instead of starting a second one
- **Three-repo update channel**: GitHub Releases as the primary source; if the check fails (common on Chinese networks) it automatically falls back to a ModelScope mirror (`maoge19523-cpu/MGCanvas2.0`), with Gitee Releases as a manual-download backup. The cloud pipeline (triggered by pushing a `v*` tag) syncs installers to all three repos automatically
- **Auto-restart after update**: on Windows the update installs and restarts automatically after user confirmation; on macOS, unsigned builds cannot auto-install (Squirrel requires code signing), so the app falls back to a guided manual download — data is never affected

## Changelog

### v1.0.123

- **New floating toolbar on Smart Canvas image nodes**: portrait & emotion adjustment, panorama, multi-angle, relighting, nine-grid templates, crop (HD / outpainting / redraw / erase / cutout / crop), element editing, layer separation, grid split, annotation, rotate, download and preview — all from one entry point
- **New "HD Upscale"**: free offline local AI upscaling to 2K / 4K; images already close to the target resolution fall back to high-quality resampling instead of forcing the AI model (about 50MB of components download on first use)
- **PSD export with real layers**: a single image is split into subject + background automatically, multiple images become one layer each, and text can be layered automatically
- **Reference videos turn into storyboard tables automatically**: works on both the classic canvas and the Smart Canvas — set "seconds per shot" (1–5, default 3) and the video is cut into one row per shot, with each row using only its own clip as the video reference
- **Canvas Agent plan mode and a rebuilt LLM console**: the Agent now presents a plan card and its impact first and only runs after you confirm, keeps a run history and matches image / video providers to the model you picked; LLM nodes and the prompt console stream as they generate, can be cancelled or retried, abort automatically when no text arrives for a long time, support @-referencing upstream assets, and use unified dropdowns for provider / model / output form
- **Upgraded image and video node parameters**: image generation adds a Background option (auto / keep / transparent), and sizes can be picked from presets, entered manually or matched to the input image's aspect ratio; video nodes add count, aspect ratio, resolution, a sound toggle and a "More parameters" panel, with a status label and elapsed time while generating
- **Consistent UI and a slimmer installer**: outlines and hairlines are gone across the app, popovers use frosted glass, every select caret is the same linear chevron and selection uses a soft tint; the HD upscale runtime and the cutout model are no longer bundled and download on first use instead
- **Fixes**: saving or downloading no longer opens several system dialogs from a single click; JSON containing real newlines from a model no longer breaks table parsing; macOS HD upscale components are made executable after extraction, so no more "Permission denied"

### v1.0.122

- **Fix**: Lovart was missing from existing installs — the platform list only received it when it was empty (fresh installs). After upgrading it shows up directly in API Settings; fill in an Access Key / Secret Key to use it. A platform without keys never appears in generation node dropdowns
- **Improvement**: an auto-added platform can no longer take over your default — a provider without configured keys is no longer picked as the primary provider

### v1.0.121

- **The Smart Canvas AI assistant is now a real Agent**: give it one instruction and the model plans and executes multiple rounds by itself (create nodes, wire connections, run generations, check tasks); every step streams live, canvas edits appear immediately, and the whole run can be rolled back
- **New Lovart design-agent provider**: image / video generation, asset upload and result download, connected with an Access Key / Secret Key
- **Chat mode on LLM nodes**: multi-turn context, selectable personas (default "Prompt Optimizer"), a live thinking process (stopwatch + breathing animation), and a draggable input height that is remembered
- **Unified motion**: dropdowns and select lists use a Glide highlight pill, buttons give state feedback (MorphButton), light/dark aware; API Settings and ComfyUI workflow settings rebuilt to one design language
- **Model selection fixes**: models you picked in canvas settings are no longer cleared or replaced by the first list entry, providers without keys no longer appear in dropdowns; a stale model left on a node after switching platforms is normalized to that platform's remembered model with a visible hint
- **Table / batch generation fixes**: each row references only its own assets, `@图片N` placeholders resolve against the global index, one batch run produces a single result node, groups containing each other no longer hang, and the mouse wheel inside tables no longer zooms the canvas

### v1.0.120

- **Fix: the Electron desktop backend failed to start** — the shell passed `--port` while the backend only accepted a positional argument, so it crashed on launch ("backend failed to load"); it now accepts `--port` / positional / env var, the first-launch wait is extended to 3 minutes, and a startup failure shows the backend log in a dialog
- **Update pipeline fixes**: `prompt_intelligence.py` added to mirror sync / one-click update / packaged resources; the fallback source order now prefers the domestic mirror and deprioritizes known-stale sources; Gitee split-volume sync recognizes the new Electron installer name
- **UI**: the top title area was rebuilt to native macOS specs (traffic lights back in place, 28px bar); side padding unified to 24px across 9 content pages

### v1.0.119

- **Update UI revamp**: the "one-click update" dialog follows the project design language (light/dark aware); when a new version is found a persistent reminder appears in the bottom-right — update now or dismiss it (the same version won't nag again, a newer one will)
- **Fix**: the ModelScope connectivity check in the update dialog pointed at a long-retired address; it now uses the `maoge19523-cpu/MGCanvas2.0` model repo

### v1.0.118

- **Windows auto-update fix**: the installer name didn't match `latest.yml` (404 downloads / checksum failures) — Electron installers are now named `MGStudio-Electron-Setup-<version>.exe`; also fixed mirror sync overwriting each other across platforms, which had left some platform update files missing

### v1.0.117

- **Fix: in-app updates on Chinese networks**: the domestic fallback pointed at a ModelScope studio page that only returns HTML (no update files); it now uses the ModelScope model-repo mirror. Unsigned macOS builds no longer attempt auto-install and instead guide a manual download

### v1.0.116

- **Lingjing API video routing**: Hailuo MiniMax, Kling, Vidu, Tongyi Wanxiang, Doubao Seedance, Luma, Runway and a generic unified format, routed automatically by model-name prefix
- **Lingjing API protocol inference**: Gemini image models automatically use the native `/v1beta` protocol while the rest stay OpenAI-compatible — no more per-model protocol setup; model fetching also fills in Gemini models hidden by token-group filtering
- **Agnes AI Video 2.5 / 2.5 Flash** video models (OpenAI Videos compatible protocol)
- **Protocol tables** gained text/image/video entries for Lingjing and Agnes; `/api/ai/descriptor` now understands the video intent for both
- **Fix**: `gpt-image-1 / 1.5` failed on some relays (the request carried the removed top-level `response_format`); it is no longer sent, and retried once without it when the upstream rejects it
- **Improvement**: generated images show their real pixel size (e.g. `gpt-image-2 · 1254×1254`) so downscaled output isn't mistaken for 2K/4K
- **Fix**: the GPT chat model picker only lists configured platforms (enabled + key + models); built-in ModelScope default chat models are retired and cleaned out of existing configs
- **Fix**: GPT chat could not be scrolled back while streaming (it now follows only when already at the bottom); the header lost its visible border and block

### v1.0.115

- **Pro color grading for image nodes**: a new Adjust mode in the image editor — glfx (WebGL) real-time filters with 5 parameter groups (light / color / curve / detail / effect) plus a draggable RGB curve, and a drag divider to compare against the original; applying creates a new image node and keeps the original
- **Group layout rebuilt**: members fill a grid sized by the group's largest original aspect ratio (full width, slack centered vertically) and reflow live while you resize the group; groups now support custom names (Enter to commit / Esc to revert)
- **One-click group run**: "Run group" on the classic canvas and "Run all" on the smart canvas execute members in order
- **Canvas assistant redesigned**: now follows Spectrum's "AI Chat Card" — the empty state types sample prompts into the composer (click to take over), sunken composer, round attach/send buttons, one-click reset
- **Connection ports rebuilt**: white outlined plus-in-circle that thickens and scales on hover/select; fixes ports being invisible in dark theme and disappearing when hovered
- **Fix**: smart canvas `#world` was positioned relative, shifting coordinate math so nodes rendered in the wrong place or not at all
- **Fix**: smart canvas image preview's **compare with original** entry point was never visible — the button was set to `display:none` by earlier logic and nothing restored it; visibility is now owned by the preview panel (hidden for video / 360 panorama, shown for images, greyed out when there is no upstream to compare)
- **Fix (important)**: historical assets missing after upgrading on Windows — the asset directory was mis-resolved because the installer ships bundled assets into the install folder, silently switching existing users there so every historical image 404'd; existing users now always keep their data directory, and `/assets` falls back to the other folder so assets on either side stay visible

### v1.0.114

- **Historical asset fix**: fixed missing historical images after macOS upgrades — the asset directory was wrongly resolved to a read-only folder inside the app bundle; it now falls back to the real data directory (`~/MGStudio/assets`), restoring canvases and local assets

### v1.0.113

- **Install & launch fix**: fixed installers failing to start — cloud builds were missing the server backend module, causing `No module named 'server'`; the server router module is now included in the repo and rebuilt into the packages, restoring the asset library / local assets / prompt library APIs

### v1.0.112

- **Unified visual refresh**: design tokens converged across 11 feature pages (marvis-shared/theme), unifying colors, spacing, radius and typography
- **GPT chat revamp**: header / input / empty state / model picker (V17-V19) redesigned
- **Configurable thinking effort**: pushed from backend, read directly by frontend
- **Fixes**: explicit size selection no longer overridden by prompt keywords (stable gpt-image-2 resolutions); gemini color-cast rollback and other backend fixes
- **Other**: beam lighting visual effects, centralized frontend icons (shared/icons.js)

### v1.0.112-beta.1 (Beta)

- **Electron desktop client**: bundled Chromium engine; shares port 3000 + the same data directory with the official build (full data interop); tray / native dialogs / window controls
- **Live update progress bar**: per-stage percentage (download / verify / backup / replace) + current file name, with toast notifications for update results
- **Three-repo update channel**: GitHub primary, automatic ModelScope mirror fallback for Chinese networks, Gitee manual-download backup
- **Desktop sidebar flicker fix**: hover-expand no longer toggles rapidly under Chromium

### v1.0.111

- **Local high-quality cutout**: image nodes get "High-Quality Cutout" — RMBG-2.0 local model downloads on demand (349MB, first use only), then offline & free; edge refinement (alpha stretch + erode/feather + background-color decontamination); one-click fallback to online cutout
- **Windows title bar drag fix**: frameless window title bar is draggable again
- **Old model cleanup**: leftover RMBG-1.4 model is removed automatically after upgrade

### v1.0.108

- **Port fix**: restored official port 3000 (accidental test-build 3001 push corrected)
- **Model whitelist**: assets/models/ added to online-update whitelist, face-detection model ships with updates

### v1.0.107

- **Face Blur tool**: select video node → one-click blur all faces in toolbar for better privacy (YuNet detection + Gaussian blur), result auto-added to node
- **Video playback fixes**: play / pause / fullscreen / progress bar fully fixed, desktop matches browser (native controls)
- **Reference media publicization**: cloud upload (Litterbox / temp.sh) preferred, no longer depends on local tunnel

### v1.0.86

- **Cloud build pipeline**: Windows/Mac cloud packaging pipelines, auto build & release
- **Carousel assets in repo**: fixed carousel images missing after updates
- **Frameless window fixes**: Win frameless drag / edge resize / title bar layout fixes
- **Mac signing optimization**: dmg ad-hoc signing prevents "damaged" warning, fixed signature broken by copy
- **Encoding fixes**: fixed Chinese encoding issues in Windows cloud builds

### v1.0.85

- **Smart Canvas fixes**: composer positioning, modal clipping, sidebar offset, title bar layout fixes

### v1.0.84

- **Canvas list enhancement**: cards support up to 4 images in 2×2 grid preview
- **Desktop upgrade**: frameless window + system tray (minimize to tray) + LAN access
- **Desktop icon update**: white-on-black rounded logo
- **Fixes**: 64-bit ctypes WndProc pointer truncation crash, pystray packaging, port conflicts
- **Repo cleanup**: improved .gitignore, excluded drafts/test screenshots/backups

### v1.0.83

- **Frontend performance**: Lucide icon subsetting (90% size reduction), NovaUtils/NovaMedia shared modules, Marvis-style CSS dedup, timer leak fixes, pause rAF rendering when hidden, touch-mouse layout cache optimization
- **Model picker redesign**: two-column layout, hover-linked provider switching, dynamic height
- **GPT chat fixes**: fixed TDZ error causing blank model picker
- **Icon & tooltip fixes**: multiple pages' Lucide icons, asset library status bar leaking English errors
- **Unified settings style**: API settings & workflow settings redesigned to Marvis style, fixed CSS syntax errors
- **New backend tool APIs**: 7 endpoints (storage management, image detection, category prompts, model normalization, RunningHub wallet status)
- **Race condition fixes**: sendChatMessage re-entry guard, setTimeout recursive polling, node.running premature reset
